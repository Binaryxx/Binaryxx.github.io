**Renewed Start**  
This post marks the day that I decided to go with GitHub Pages to use as a website to act as my portfolio. I originally intended on working with WordPress, but I found out that this is a completely free alternative available. Although there may not be features that make website development easier. I decided to follow through since I have some basic knowledge of HTML and JavaScript in the past to try my hand at coding my own website. Luckily, Jekyll exists and will help in facilitating this journey. I have been putting off making a website since I thought linking github repositories would suffice; but depending on the audience, it may be too intimidating or cumbersome to navigate without prior exposure. So this is just a natural adjustment for me to make. Hopefully this website can also help my case in regard justifying the gap in unemployment and show what I have been working on, on a professional or personal level.    
  
Not much to talk about in this post. It serves more so as a marker for when it all started. I hope to use posts as a way to mark future milestones and keep a paper trail of what is happening as it relates to my professional career. Good luck to me going forward!
