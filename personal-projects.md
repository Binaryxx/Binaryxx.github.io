Below are projects that I have worked on in my spare time. Most, if not all, will be related to video game development. Although they may not directly help in the job search, they are still projects nonetheless that required a period of learning and practice to complete.

### Audio   
   
**Practice #1** 
First music clip to produce. Focused on using simple chords from the C major scale and kept rhythm fairly simple. Learned how to give space to the lead and how to use notes that either resolve or create tension.   
Only made up of 2 separate tracks. One track for the melody (piano) and another for the harmony (strings).  
This music clip focuses on a more upbeat and happy mood, supposedly for an upbeat beach town background track.

**Practice #2**  
Used a different scale to practice using accidentals. Focused on varying rhythm and repeating the same notes since the last clip relied on movement too much.  
Used 4 tracks. Plucked violin notes for the lead. For the harmony, the piano covered the mid range, the cello covered the low range, and the drums established the rhyhtm.  
This music clip takes a motif from Practice 1 and uses it to transition to a slower and calm nighttime walk in town soundtrack.

**Practice #3** and **Practice #4**    
Practice 4 includes Practice 3 and creating a slower and calmer version. Practice 3 is the combat music, while Practice 4 is the overworld exploration music. This clip transitions from exploration to combat and back to exploration. Focused on distilling repeating motifs in Practice 3 to create a calmer version that is still identifiable as similar to its faster counterpart. Utilized amps to make the same instruments more intense. Changed instrumentation as needed, such as switching out the woodwinds with horns.   
This music clip has a western twang to it, which I attribute to the guitar used. Because of this, the imagery for this clip is traveling in a wasteland desert and encountering enemy bandits.

**Practice #5**  
No particular concept to focus in Practice 5. I wanted to use the horns and 808s that I have made through synths.  
This music clip is supposed to be more city like and tense. This is because I wanted to rely heavily on the low end such as the drums, bass, and 808s which is reminiscence of R&B.

**Prototype #1**  
Prototype #1 is supposed to be the culmination of my practice. It is the first complete song that I have made that has an intro, verse, chorus, bridge, and outro, which varying levels of emotion and energy for each one.  I drew inspiration from R&B Soul songs such as the following: "Saturn" by SZA, "Let You Break My Heart Again" by Laufey, "May I Ask" by Luke Chiang, "WESTSIDE" by keshi, "500 Days" by dept, and "Afterthought" by Joji.  
I wanted to focus on nice standalone melodies and harmonies that can stand by their own without lyrics. This is because I enjoy songs based on whether they sound pleasant. From there, when I take a closer listen and decipher the lyrics, it is another layer of depth to enjoy for when I listen to the song.  
I chose G Major to create a nice peaceful tone with a nice and calm 80 BPM. The song sounds very different from the inspiration sources, but is able to convey the level of peace and calm.

**Binky the Cat Emote Sequence**  
3D Modeled a mascot cat and then animated a sequence of movements. The movements involve a heel click jump, chest pound, and a point towards the camera. Learned add texture maps, rig, and animate a 3d model. 
Also rendered the same sequence with effects such as pixelation and cel shading.

### Coding  
**PongX**  
Coded a Pong clone with additional features such as the ability to manipulate the ball's bounce off a wall based on the return shot type and increasing ball speed per hit. Includes original bgm and sfx.  
Learned how to address the issue of tunneling and how to use Godot in general.
