Welcome to Binaryxx Sune's Website!  
  
Here you will find a variety of my projects, ranging from personal to professional and even a combination of the two.  
The navigation bar at the top of the webpage will link pages to my personal and professional projects, aptly named "Personal Projects" and "Professional Projects" respectively. In addition, there will be an option to learn more about me in the "About Me" page, which includes access to my resume for those interested.  
  
Below you can find my posts, which will be internal monologues to myself, which will also serve as a way to track milestones.
